I'm trying to make changes-- this is Brooke.

## Week 1 Meeting (June 4)

TEST changes.

We went through three examples: 

* Creating a graph that showed countries' medal-standings for the Sochi Olympics (since the R code pulled data directly from a website, it could be updated by just re-running the code as standings changed during the Olympics)
* Showing worldwide incidence of pirate attacks since 1978 through a series of pngs created with R
* Finding the best meeting point on the Paris metro via a Shiny app

Pieces of example code to play with for these examples are included in the .R files. All examples came from others' blogs-- full attribution is provided in the comments of the R code for each example.

## Week 2 Meeting (June 10)

This week, we'll play around some with git and GitHub. I've [added R files](https://github.com/geanders/test-repo/tree/master/Week_1_Meeting) for the examples in our Week 1 meeting to the "Week 1" directory in my [test-repo repository](https://github.com/geanders/test-repo), so we'll see if everyone can branch this repo to their own GitHub accounts and then pull it onto their own computers to try out the code. 

We'll also see if everyone can edit the [README](https://github.com/geanders/test-repo/blob/master/README.md) file in this repo to add examples of interesting data science and analysis that they've found. We'll then see if everyone can request that their changes be added to the original file.
